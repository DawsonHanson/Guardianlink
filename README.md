Guardianlink was completed for a school project. 

The purpose of the project is to create an application that allows users to view relevant 
information on other users, and allow communication between those users. A user will be of two types,
either a volunteer who is donating time and cybersecurity skills to, a company user who is requesting 
cybersecurity assistance.

The goals for the project are to present users with an easy to use application that shows information in a clear manner.
And to ensure that communication and user profiles are managed effectively and securely, by utilizing access control and 
administrative users to manage profiles.
